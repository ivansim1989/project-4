For more information about our Laboratory, please visit: http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/oeil/.   The proposed study aims to assess the biomechanics of the lamina cribrosa (LC) in vivo. The lamina cribrosa (LC), at the back of the eye, provides mechanical supports to the axons that pass through and transmit visual information to the brain. Because the LC is porous, it is mechanically weak, and is the major site of axonal damage in glaucoma – the most common cause of irreversible blindness. Throughout the day and night, the LC is exposed to three major loads: the intraocular pressure (IOP; pushing the LC posteriorly), the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP; pushing the LC anteriorly), and during eye movements, by the traction from the optic nerve distorting the LC. We believe that excessive and cumulative deformations of the LC from any of these loads could result in glaucomatous axonal damage. We also believe that the biomechanical behaviour of the LC is different between healthy and glaucoma subjects, and that accurate in vivo measurements of LC biomechanics could help us better diagnose glaucoma.   For this project, the successful candidate will use, improve and develop 3D image processing algorithms to assess the biomechanics of the LC in response to changes in IOP, CSFP and gaze position in a large population of normal and glaucoma patients (imaged under various conditions with 3D optical coherence tomography).   The candidate will also assess how information about LC biomechanics could be used to better understand and diagnose glaucoma. This will be done using custom artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithms in collaboration with the OCTAGON team (http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/OEIL/OCTAGON.html). Finally, the candidate will also be expected to provide assistance while patients are being imaged.   This is a project in collaboration with the Singapore Eye Research Institute (top 5 eye institute worldwide).","RequirementsQualification: Excellent programming skills (in C++ and Matlab/Python) and knowledge of 3D image tracking techniques (e.g. digital volume correlation) are required. The candidate is also expected to have a strong foundation in nonlinear continuum mechanics and finite element modeling. Knowledge of the Virtual Fields Method, code parallelization, optical coherence tomography, and deep learning is considered a plus. Hands-on experience in mechanical or biomechanical testing is also considered a plus. No background in ophthalmology is required. Candidates with PhD in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, or other related disciplines are encouraged to apply.   Earliest Starting Date: July 2018.   Duration: 3 years.     To apply, please email a detailed CV and the names of two references to:   Dr. Michael JA Girard Ophthalmic Engineering & Innovation Laboratory Department of Biomedical Engineering National University of Singapore Email: jobs@invivobiomechanics.com Homepage: http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/oeil/"

This project has the ambition to create a step-improvement in health promotion and chronic disease management, pioneering capabilities with tech giants to front global-first co-innovation. It will also allow for the real time tracking of the Singapore population's health behaviours, and potentially give Government a much more accurate read of how the population responds to policy changes and allow for personalised services delivered at national scale.  By providing a research platform for new medical interventions, it has the potential to accelerate the adoption of a whole range of clinical interventions.  The project will involve a range private sector players coming in to use Singapore as a test bed to trial new products and services in precision health and medicine.  Key technologies that are likely to be trialled in this project are health related wearable and sensor technology, big data analytics, machine learning, behavioural science, genomics and precision medicine.      The Strategy and Industry Lead will assist the Coordinating Director to:    Strategise, plan and formulate the vision, implementation strategy and roadmap (including workstreams, team structures, timelines and budgets) for TeNHP; Reach out, assess, prioritise and implement key partnerships with private sector leaders in technology and healthcare sector to participate on our platform. This includes rallying and coordinating action from MOH and WOG implementation agencies and stakeholders (HPB, IHIS, Regional Hospital Systems, Govtech, SNPO, A*STAR, EDB, universities and research institutes), cutting through red tape to move quickly on joint industry engagement on all health technology matters; Manage, assess and report on overall project progress (business, technology, industry, policy, comms/marketing etc.), manage inter-dependencies and key project risks, and suggest adjustments to strategy and implementation plan to maximise value optimisation. This involves using new tools and coordinating beyond public sector to private sector partners as well in a cross-functional team.  ",
